# awesome-reports
A simple jekyll template made for publishing a web-based report rather than a PDF.

## Editing
If you clone this template and want to edit it locally be sure to comment out (using the # mark) or delete the url from the baseurl in the `_config.yml` file. If you publish a version on gh-pages you will need to copy the that url into the baseurl to correctly map to your site.
